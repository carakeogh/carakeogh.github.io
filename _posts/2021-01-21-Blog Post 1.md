# Blog Post 1

This blog post illustrates how to create interactive data graphics by creating and querying databases and using plotly express for graphing. We use climate data from NOAA in this exercise.

## Part 1: Create a Database

The first thing we need to do is create a database of our data. To do this, we load in some packages that we will need to accomplish our tasks. Note that we use `sqlite3`, which allows us to use some SQL commands in Python. Then, we establish a connection with our database, which we name "climate.db".


```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import numpy as np
```


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db")
```

Now we need to read in the data. This can be done from url links or from csv files. This example uses csv files. 

We use the pandas function `pd.read_csv()` to read in our data. Then, we use `df.to_sql()` to create a table in our database with the information we just read in. 


```python
stations = pd.read_csv("station-metadata.csv")
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

countries = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

temperatures = pd.read_csv("temps.csv")
temperatures["country_ID"] = temperatures["ID"].str[0:2] #get a column of the FIPS abbreviation for each country
temperatures.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

    /Applications/anaconda3/envs/PIC16B/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py:2872: UserWarning:
    
    The spaces in these column names will not be changed. In pandas versions < 0.14, spaces were converted to underscores.
    


Then we can check that our tables have all been populated in our database. The output shows we have three tables of data: stations, countries, and temperatures.


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('stations',), ('countries',), ('temperatures',)]


Lastly, we should close our connection to the database with `conn.close`. Next time we want to access the database, we can just reopen the connection, as we did above with `sqlite3.connect()`.


```python
conn.close()
```

## Part 2: Write a Query Function

Now that we have created our database, we want to write a query function that will return a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for a user-specified country, in the user-specified date range, in the user-specified month of the year. 

**Step 1**: 
The first step is to create a general query function that includes all the necessary information from our database. We start by opening the connection to our database. We use `SELECT` to choose what data we want returned from our database. We use `FROM` to determine what tables the data is taken from. We use `LEFT JOIN` to return data from two tables that match. We give `temperatures`, `stations`, and `countries` the aliases of `S`, `T`, and `C`, respectively, to make our command easier to read and use. Lastly, we assign our query to a dataframe `full_df` and close our connection.

**Step 2**: 
The second step is to clean our dataframe that is produced by the query. Our dataframe currently has several columns titled "VALUE1", "VALUE2", etc., which each represents all of the temperature readings for one month. It would be more helpful if all of our temperature data were in the same column. To do this, we use a `pandas` method  called `stack`. Here are the steps for `stack`ing data:
1. `df.set_index(keys=[LIST]` Convert all of the columns that we don't want to stack into a multi-index for the data    frame.
2. `df.stack()` Call the `stack` method, which puts all the data values on top of each other. This also creates a new column that indicates where our data came from in the original table.
3. `df.reset_index()` resets the index, which can get messed up from `stack`ing.

After we have stacked our data, we can relabel our columns to be more understandable and make any changes that might be necessary.

**Step 3**:
Finally, we are able use `pandas` filtering and boolean indexing to create and return a data frame with the user-requested info. `df.between(start, end)` lets us inclusively filter values to be in a certain range. Then, we return the final dataframe to the user.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    
    """
    This function return a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for a user-specified country, 
    in the user-specified date range (year_begin and year_end), in the user-specified month of the year. 
    """
    
    #Step 1: create a general query function that includes the necessary information
    ##     (temperatures, names, lats/longs) for all countries, years, and months
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db")
    
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, T.*, C.name
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON T.country_id = C."FIPS 10-4"
    """
    
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    
    #Step 2: Clean up the data frame produced by the query
    
    #gives columns more understandable names
    df = df.rename(columns={'NAME': 'station_name', 'Name': 'Country'})
    
    #stack data to create a single "Months" column
    df = df.set_index(keys=["station_name", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "ID", "Year", "country_ID", "Country"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    #rename colmns
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_7"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temperature (C)"})
    #Convert column values to integers 1-12 to represent months
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    
    #drop unnecessary columns
    df = df.drop(["ID", "country_ID"], axis=1)
    
    #get units of degrees Celsius
    df["Temperature (C)"] = df["Temperature (C)"]/100
    
    #change the order of columns in the data frame
    df = df[["station_name", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "Country", "Year", "Month", "Temperature (C)"]]
      
        
    #Step 3: Use pandas filtering to create and return a data frame with the user-requested info
    
    final_df = df[(df["Year"].between(year_begin, year_end)) & (df["Month"] == 1) & (df["Country"] == country)]

    return final_df
```

Once we have written our query function, we can call it with our own arguments! Here, we want temperature readings for India, in January between the years of 1980-2020, and we are returned a data frame with nicely organized information.


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India",
                       year_begin = 1980,
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

## Part 3: Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

In this part, we will write a function to create visualizations that address the question: <br>
*How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?*

Let's first define a linear regression function which we will use in our other function to calculate the year-over-year average change in temperature in each month at each station.


```python
#compute the first coefficient of a linear regression model at that station
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def lin_reg(df):
    
    """
    This function computes the first coefficient of a linear regression model at that station and 
    returns a column of the first coefficients from the model to the user-specified dataframe.
    """
    
    # we use two brackets because x is a dataframe
    x = df[["Year"]] 
    # we use one bracket because y is a series
    y = df["Temperature (C)"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    df["coefs"] = LR.coef_[0]
    return df
```

To make our interactive visualizations, we will be using Plotly Express, so we import it.


```python
from plotly import express as px
```

Now we can define our plotting function. The first thing we do is call our `query_climate_database` function that we defined in Part 2 to create a data frame, `query_df`. Then, we create a column "Count" that counts the number of years worth of data is available for each station and month. Next we call the `lin_reg(df)` function that we defined above, which creates a column of the coefficients generated. Then we use our "Count" column to filter the dataframe based on the minimum observations required by the user. <br>
After we have our data frame, we can make our plot. This is very similar to previous plots we have made, but this time we are using plotly express. We will make a scatterplot on a map using `px.scatter_mapbox`. The arguments that you might not have seen before are:
- `lat`: latitude
- `lon`: longitude
- `hover_name`: value shown when the user hovers over the plot
- `color_continuous_midpoint`: sets the midpoint of the color bar
<br><br>
We also include `**kwargs` to give our user options to further modify the graph to their specifications. Our function returns the figure.



```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    
    """
    This function returns a plotly figure that is a scatterplot on a country map, which shows the
    year-over-year average change in temperature in a user-specified month in a range of years
    (year_begin and year_end) at each station in a user-specificed country. The user also specifies
    a minimum number of observations (min_obvs) required for each station.
    """
    
    query_df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    query_df["Count"] = query_df.groupby("station_name")["Temperature (C)"].transform(len).astype(int)
    
    coefs = query_df.groupby(["station_name"]).apply(lin_reg)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    
    graph_df = coefs[coefs["Count"] >= min_obs]
    graph_df = graph_df.round({"coefs": 4})
    
    
    #Make the plot
    
    months_dict = {1: "January", 2: "February", 3: "March", 4: "April", 5: "May", 6: "June", 7: "July",
                   8: "August", 9: "September", 10: "October", 11: "November", 12: "December"}
    
    fig_title = "Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in " + months_dict.get(month) + " for stations in " + country + ", years " + str(year_begin) + " - " + str(year_end)
    
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(graph_df, 
                            title = fig_title,
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "station_name", 
                            color = "coefs",
                            opacity = 0.5,
                            height = 300,
                            color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                            **kwargs)
    
    fig.update_coloraxes(colorbar_title_text = "Estimated Yearly Increase (\N{DEGREE SIGN}C)")
    #reduce the margins around the graph
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":40,"l":0,"b":0})
    
    return fig
```

Now we can call our function and use it to make a plot according to our preferences.


```python
# choose a colormap
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()

plt.savefig('tempcoefplot.png')
```

## Part 4: Create Two More Interesting Figures

We will use the same dataset to create two more interactive visualizations.

### 3d Scatterplot
We will make a 3d scatterplot to try to answer this question: <br>
*How does temperature vary around the world in relation to longitude and latitude, and does one affect temperature more than the other?*

We will follow steps similar to what we did in Part 2. 

**Step 1**: Create a query that gets the latitude and longitude of all stations, all of the temperature data, and the country names.

**Step 2**: Clean the data as necessary. Stack the temperature data to get a Months column.

**Step 3**: Use filtering and boolean indexing to to create and return a data frame with the user-requested info. We can use `df.isin()` to filter the data frame on an iterable (in this case we use a list).

**Step 4**: Plot the figure with `px.scatter_3d`. The difference in this plot is that we have the argument `z`, which specifies the third axis. We return the figure.


```python

    """

    df = df.drop(["ID", "country_ID"], axis = 1)
    
    df = df.set_index(keys=["LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE", "Year", "Name"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_4"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temperature (C)"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)

    months_dict = {1: "January", 2: "February", 3: "March", 4: "April", 5: "May", 6: "June", 7: "July",

    fig_title = "Relationship between locations and temperatures, " + months_dict.get(month) + " " + str(year)
    fig = px.scatter_3d(df,

                        y = "LONGITUDE",
                        z = "Temperature (C)",
                        color = "Name",
                        opacity = 0.2,
                        title = fig_title,
                        **kwargs)
    
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":40,"l":0,"b":0},
                      legend_title_text='Country')
    
    return fig
```

Now we can call our function to plot our figure. 


```python
C = ["China", "Mexico", "India", "Brazil", "South Africa", "United Kingdom", "Thailand", "Russia"]

fig = temp_location_plot(C, 2010, 1)

fig.show()

plt.savefig('templocplot.png')
```

### Line graph
We will make a linegraph to try to answer this question: <br>
*Has the average mean temperature at different stations in the same month increased over time?*

Again, we follow the same steps as above.

**Step 1**: Create a query that gets the name of all stations, all of the temperature data, and the country names.

**Step 2**: Clean the data as necessary. Stack the temperature data to get a Months column.

**Step 3**: Use filtering and boolean indexing to to create and return a data frame with the user-requested info. We can use `df.isin()` to filter the data frame on an iterable (in this case we use a list).

**Step 4**: Plot the figure with `px.line`.


```python
def line_plot(station_list, country, month):
    
    """
    This function returns a line graph of the average temperature for a 
    user-specified list of stations (stations_list) in a user-specified country
    overtime in a user-specified month.
    """
    
    #Step 1
   
    conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db")

    cmd = \

    """

    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    
    #Step 2
    
    df = df.rename(columns={'NAME': 'station_name', 'Name': 'Country'})

    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temperature (C)"] = df["Temperature (C)"]/100

    df = df[df["Country"] == country]
    
    df["Mean Temp"] = df.groupby(["Country", "Year"])["Temperature (C)"].transform(np.mean)

    filt = df["station_name"].isin(SL)
